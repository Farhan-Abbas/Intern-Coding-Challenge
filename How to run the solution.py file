I am using a virtual environment for this project.
The virtual environment contains the pandas library therefore you don't have to install anything extra.

To activate the virtual environment, please use:
Linux/MacOS: source venv/bin/activate
Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Then, please run the solution.py file and it will generate an Output.json file which will contain the list of common signals.

Thank you!
